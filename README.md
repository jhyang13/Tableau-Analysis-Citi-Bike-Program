Jiahui's homework for Module 18

## The Data Folder
- The database used for this challenge is from 04/2023 to 06/2023.
- JC-202304-202306-citibike-tripdata.xlsx contains all the data.

## Tableau Workbook File
- Citi-Bike-Analytics.twb is the Tableau Workbook for this challenge.
- The Tableau that I used to finish this challenge is the 2019.1 version.
- In case you cannot open the twb file, please check Citi-Bike-Analytics.pptx or Citi-Bike-Analytics.pdf, which contain all the work in the twb file.
- Because of this old version of Tableau, I cannot share my twb file with Tableau Public.
